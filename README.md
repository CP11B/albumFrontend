The specifications given to me were: 
> "To create a CRUD application with the utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training."

As long as it met those criteria, I had free reign to choose whatever topics/styles I liked.

In the end I chose an album display CRUD app, utilizing the Java, SQL and front-end skills I have learnt. I chose this because I enjoy music and thought album artwork was pretty cool on display.
The app displays album information such as:
- Title
- Artist
- Year Released 
- Images
- Links (to a playlist)

It meets the above criteria be being able to do the following:
###  Create
- Add new albums. 
### Read
- Display all the albums.
### Update
- Edit and add to the existing album information.
### Delete
- Remove the album from the database

## Languages Used
Java (pretty much exlusively on the backend)
HTML CSS and Javascript on the front end.
